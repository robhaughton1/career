    <h2>What is their Personality?</h2>
    <p>A good RT is patient, empathetic, and calm in most dire situations so that they can bring out the best in their patients well being. Technology for a RT can be CPAP machines, respiratory machines, IV, or anything pertaining to the thoraxic region of the body. Their average salary is 70,000 a year, but it can reach a wopping 100,000. Education wise, they typically need an associate or bachelors degree. </p>
